# Orion API

> API for exploring new technologies and server-side toys (libs and frameworks)

This project is a Node API used to try out new technologies and libraries, both in this project
itself, as well as providing an actual API to explore different client-side technologies. This
version of the project exposes a single GraphQL endpoint and is backed by a Postgres data store.

Other interesting technologies to note:

-   Written in Typescript
-   Utilizes TypeORM and Type GraphQL
-   Postgres & pgAdmin (web interface to manage postgres) run as docker containers
